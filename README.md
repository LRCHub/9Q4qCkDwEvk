[00:31.51] Like the wind
[00:35.19] You came here running
[00:38.88] Take the consequence of living
[00:46.35] There's no space
[00:50.03] There's no tomorrow
[00:53.83] But we need some munication
[00:59.56] Check it in, check it out
[01:01.75] But the sun will never shine
[01:07.28] Paranoid anyway in the subways of your mind
[01:16.27] Like the wind
[01:19.99] Blowing from somewhere
[01:23.65] Let a smile be your companion
[01:31.29] There's no place
[01:34.98] For any sorrow
[01:38.47] Time for young and restless dreamin'
[01:44.56] Check it in, check it out
[01:46.47] But the sun will never shine
[01:52.07] Paranoid anyway in the subways of your mind
[02:29.19] Check it in, check it out
[02:30.91] But the sun will never shine
[02:36.59] Paranoid anyway in the subways of your mind
[02:44.04] Check it in check it out
[02:45.87] It's the summer blues
[02:47.88] Tear it in, tear it out
[02:49.68] It's the good excuse
[02:51.48] Check it in check it out
[02:53.27] It's the summer blues
[02:55.27] Tear it in, tear it out
[02:57.11] It's the good excuse
[02:58.92] Check it in check it out
[03:00.76] It's the summer blues
[03:02.68] Tear it in, tear it out
[03:04.51] It's the good excuse
[03:06.40] Check it in check it out
[03:08.20] It's the summer blues
[03:10.11] Tear it in, tear it out
[03:11.88] It's the good excuse
